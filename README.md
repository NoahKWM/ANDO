# Data Analysis

This repo contains the Data Analysis project of my 2nd year at ENSIIE engineering school.

The goal of the project was to implement an unsupervised classification tool called **Generalized K-means**. To do so, my binome and I used the PCA in order to find the line that passes through a points cloud while minimizing the distance of the points from the line.
This recursive algorithm is basically the K-means but we used lines instead of points as class representatives.
